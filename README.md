# projectGOAT

## Background

Project G.O.A.T acronym for Greatest Of All Time will be a data visualization dedicated to the G.O.A.T himself Kobe Bryant due to his passing away yesterday alongside his daughter Gianna in a tragic helicopter crash (may they rest in peace). This will showcase his achievements in Basketball, business and life, showing why he is indeed the greatest of all time and how he came from nothing.

## Functionality and MVPs

Users will be able to view:

* A splash page that embodies a memorial to Kobe Bryant
* In the splash page there will be a button that redirects them to the data visualization page
* Multiple interactive charts that highlights Kobe Bryant’s achievements
* Credits page for every possible person with enough info that played a major role in Kobe Bryant’s life and success.


Bonus MVPs:

* A spotify web player to stream Kobe Bryant’s favorite songs
* A production README

## Wireframes

This Single-page data visualization app will consist of multiple sections and charts for different aspects highlighting the best of Kobe Bryant which will be interactive with the user. Also, it will have a splash page and a credits page as well alongside my Linkedin and Github links and will have buttons to refer the user to the right section and not solely rely on scrolling up and down.

## Architecture and Technologies

The app will use the following technologies for implementation:
* ``` JavaScript ``` Will be used for development.
* Different libraries will be used such as ```D3js```, ```ChartJS```, ```ThreeJS```, ```Metric-Graphics```.
* Also, multiple APIs are going to be used for the core of data.

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1:** Implementing the entry file and installing all the necessary node modules and work on the splash page and test out the newly introduced libraries to get more familiarized with them.

**Day 2:** search for the right APIs for the right data and resources and test them out. Work on having a basic charts for testing purposes to envision the project on a bigger picture.

**Day 3:** after fetching the right data from different APIs they will be implemented on the app and the charts will be based on those APIs and will be finalized by then.

**Day 4:** implement interaction between user input and the data visualization and work on adding up the finishing touches with more CSS and make the credits page as well.
